-   **Unit 7: Our World - Nature, the Body, Identity, Sexuality,
    Politics, and Power**  

    *In this unit, we will look at how artists express and interpret our
    world. If nothing else, visual art provides an avenue for
    self-expression. As a primary source, artists express attitudes,
    feelings, and sentiments about environments through personal
    experiences, social interaction, and relationships with the natural
    world. In short, art helps us perceive and react to our place in the
    world. In Unit 1, we referred to description as one of many roles
    art takes on, but this description is often imbued with the artist's
    subjective interpretation. In this unit, we will examine how art
    operates as a vehicle for human expression - a kind of collective
    visual metaphor that helps to define who we are.*

        Contrast: Form and
        Content"](http://school.saylor.org/mod/quiz/view.php?id=1932) (HTML)  
            
         Instructions: The theme of 'Mother and Child' is common to most
        world cultures, but the form and content within the theme
        changes. View the two examples from this theme below, then
        compare and contrast them in terms of their forms and the
        content they reflect. Read the descriptions about each of the
        works to help you determine any difference, but use your own
        words to describe the works. Be specific in your answers. Your
        descriptions should include:

        -   Subject matter: What does the work represent?
        -   Formal qualities of each work and their visual effects on
            the viewer
        -   Areas of focus: What's included and what isn't?
        -   Issues of content: what meaning do you get out of each work?
            Is it different for both or the same? Why? Why not?
        -   What context is each work seen in? Does that make a
            difference in the content? 

        Find a third image from this theme on your own and include it in
        your discussion. Make sure your choice represents a different
        culture than the first two (African and western European). Be
        sure to include a link to your choice and use proper citation
        for any source material you refer to.  
           
         Here are links to the first two works:

        -   [Mother and
            Child](http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/312336)

        -   Mary Cassatt's [Maternal

        the activity, you may record your answer anywhere you like. You
        do have the option to use the link above to save your answers on
