-   **Unit 1: Definitions, Artistic Roles, and Visual Thinking**  

    *How would you define art? For many people, art is a tangible
    entity: a painting, sculpture, photograph, dance, poem, or play. Art
    is uniquely human and tied directly to culture. As an expressive
    medium, it allows us to experience joy, sorrow, confusion, and
    clarity. It gives voice to ideas and feelings, connects us to the
    past, reflects the present, and anticipates the future. Visual art
    is a rich and complex subject whose definition is in flux as the
    culture around it changes. This unit examines how art is defined,
    and the different ways it functions in societies and cultures.*

         Instructions: What has been your exposure to visual art? Has it
        been primarily from your family? School? Social activities?
        Personal explorations? Do you make art? If so, what kind? What
        is the medium you use? What kind of style is it? Look under
        "style" in module 1 to get a better idea of what it might be.
        Who is your audience? If you haven't made any art, have you ever
        wanted to? What kind?

         Instructions: Artistic styles change over time and throughout
        cultures, yet some forms continue to be repeated despite the
        changes. Examining these forms helps in finding the meaning.  
           
         View the three works of art from the hyperlinks below. They are
        all from different time periods and cultures. Notice how each
        one has a repeated formal element similar to the others. 

        -   What style and category does each work belong to?
        -   Do these similarities have ties to a common meaning between
            all of them, or do you think the meaning for each work is
            separate from the others? Why or why not?
        -   What cultural, religious or other considerations do you take
            into account in defining your answers?
        -   Write at least one paragraph to explain each work of art.
