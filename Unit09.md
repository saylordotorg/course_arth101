-   **Unit 9: Art in Time and Place - The Western World**  

    *The formal and stylistic aspects of artworks are often determined
    largely by the era and location in which they were created. In this
    unit, we will study art through its evolution in time and place in
    the Western world. You will develop the tools you need to identify
    the major formal and stylistic trends punctuating the timeline of
    Western art history. This approach will enable us to see the
    relationship between works of art and their specific
    social-historical contexts. This unit will also reveal a certain
    continuum that runs through Western art from Ancient Greece to
    modern times.*
