-   **Unit 8: Other Worlds - Mortality, the Spirit, and Fantasy**  

    *Humans use art to capture ideas about worlds outside our own. Art
    is often a vehicle for myth: how we understand and explain concepts
    of a spirit world. Cultures use iconography to symbolize abstract
    ideas like dreams, love, power, and emotion, and societies call on
    the artist to create them. Art also plays a significant role in
    ritual and ceremony. In this unit, we will learn how human thought,
    belief, and imagination are materialized through art.*
