-   **Unit 4: How Art Works - The Elements and Principles of Visual
    Language**  

    *In this unit, you will begin to learn the terms that used to
    describe and analyze any work of art, and you will explore the
    principles of design - the means by which the elements in a work of
    art are arranged and orchestrated. Just as spoken language is based
    on phonemes, syntax, and semantics, visual art is based on elements
    and principles that, when used together, create works that
    communicate ideas and meaning to the viewer. We can think of them as
    the building blocks of an artwork's composition - the organized
    layout of an image or object, according to the principles of
    design.*

    **Unit 4 Time Advisory**  

    Completing this unit should take you approximately 16.5 hours:  
        
     ☐    Subunit 4.1: 6.5 hours  
        
     ☐    Subunit 4.2: 10 hours

    **Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  

    Upon completion of this unit, you will be able to:

    -   define and describe artistic elements and principles of design;
    -   differentiate between a realistic artwork and an abstract
        composition; and
    -   compare and contrast artworks from disparate cultures using the
        language of art.

        the linked PDF, find two works of art: the first one
        two-dimensional, the second three-dimensional. For each one,
        write four sentences describing the elements present in the work
        using the Formalist Method. This method describes what you see
        in a totally objective way. Do not refer to any subject matter.
        Remember, be objective in your descriptions. An example might
        be; "The work uses a majority of organic shapes", or "It uses
        the complimentary colors yellow and violet for contrast".

        Then, for each work, write one sentence that describes your
        subjective reaction. An example might be "The artwork has a
        chaotic feeling to it", or "Looking at the work made me feel
        lonely".

         Instructions: Using any of the [External
        Links](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ARTH101B-5-Learning-Activites-Module-5.pdf) from
        the linked PDF, find two works of art: the first one
        two-dimensional, the second one three-dimensional. For each one,
        write four sentences describing the artistic principles present
        in the work. Do not refer to any subject matter. Be objective in
        your descriptions. An example might be; "The work makes an
        abundant use of pattern," or "this work uses asymmetric balance
        in its composition".

        Then, for each work, write one sentence that describes your
        subjective reaction. An example might be "The artwork has a
        dynamic feel to it" or "The scale in this work disorients
        me".

         Instructions: Complete this assignment, using the interpretive
        skills you have learned in this course so far.  
           
         Using the links below, describe the two compositions and your
        reaction to each of them.  

        -   What kind of visual balance is used in each?
        -   How does the balance affect the composition?
        -   Explain how effective each work is in terms of unity and
            variety. Example: "there is variety in the colors used, but
            they are mostly analogous to each other, and that creates a
            unity in the overall effect". Be specific and include any
            links or images that help support your answers.

        from the linked PDF as resources, choose two works of art from
        two different cultures. They can be two or three-dimensional, or
        one of each. Compare and contrast the two works, using the
        artistic principles you've learned about in this module. For
        example:

        -   How do the compositions compare to each other?
        -   How are they similar? • How are they different?
        -   What are the artistic principles being used in each
            (repetition, rhythm, scale, differences in visual balance,
            etc.)? You can refer to the subject matter in each work, but
            focus on objective comparisons.
