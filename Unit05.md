-   **Unit 5: Artistic Media**  

    *Artists find ways to express themselves with almost any resource
    available. It is a stamp of their creativity to make extraordinary
    images and objects from various, but somewhat ordinary, materials:
    Using charcoal, paper, thread, paint, ink - and even found objects
    such as leaves - artists continue to search for ways to construct
    and deliver their message. In this unit, we look at artworks created
    from two- and three-dimensional media and arts made using different
    types of cameras.*

         Instructions: Complete this activity in which you will focus on
        how different mediums dictate what artists can express.  
           
         Marshall McLuhan's quote that "the medium is the message" helps
        us understand the frontiers and limits of the tools we use.
        Artistic mediums are not only extensions of our creativity but
        avenues that help define changes in scale. For example, the
        introduction of painting extends by leaps and bounds what
        drawing could do.  

        -   Using the [External
            Links](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ARTH101B-5-Learning-Activites-Module-5.pdf)
            from the linked PDF, find one example of each
            two-dimensional medium discussed in module 6; drawing,
            painting, printmaking and collage. Write a short summary of
            how the nature of each medium dictates the expression of the
            artist using it. In other words, what makes each medium
            unique, and how does it limit or expand what the artist is
            able to do with it?

        Film Study"**

        Study"](http://forums.saylor.org/topic/discussion-question-11-film-study/) (HTML)  
            
         Instructions: The film industry is a major part of the economy
        and, like other artistic mediums, it both reflects and
        anticipates the culture surrounding it, although Hollywood
        arguably has a culture all its own. Now, independent films
        (those made outside of the big Hollywood studios) are having a
        larger effect on audiences because they can examine themes and
        ideas beyond what the big studios decide to finance. Respond to
        the following questions. 

        -   How often do you see a film? 
        -   Do you view films in a theatre or on other digital media? 
        -   What kind of films do you like; human interest stories,
            action films, romances, fantasy or animation? 
        -   What are your thoughts on film's role to entertain and
            inform? 
        -   What is your favorite film? Why?

         Instructions: Complete this assignment using the interpretive
        skills that you have learned so far in this course.  
           
         The photograph (or digital image) freezes a moment in time,
        encapsulating an idea and the narrative surrounding it. View the
        three photos linked below. Use your interpretive skills learned
        in the course to describe the form and content of each image.
        Respond to the following questions.

        -   What is the photo expressing?
        -   What is the subject matter in each image?
        -   How do formal considerations contribute to your
            interpretation of each picture's content?

        Here are the three photos:

         Instructions: For thousands of years sculpture has (literally)
        been the bedrock of three-dimensional art. Carved from stone or
        wood, or cast in bronze, so often figurative and, from a western
        cultural perspective, in a realistic style.  
           
         The advent of modern art in the first half of the twentieth
        century has radically changed the formal characteristics of
        sculpture and, in some cases, the content. View the three
        sculptures from the links provided below and comment on the
        issues of form and content in each one.

         Instructions: Complete this assignment using the interpretive
        skills that you have learned so far in this course.  
           
         Since the 1960's installation and performance art have taken
        their place alongside traditional sculpture - and in some ways
        eclipsed it as the most significant contemporary
        three-dimensional art form. View the installation [Cold Dark
        Matter](http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/value-art-cornelia-parker-cold-dark-matter-gallery-activity)
        by Cornelia Parker and read an
        [interview](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-features/7838693/Cornelia-Parker-interview.html)
        with the artist. In addition, view and read about Ann Hamilton's
        installation
        [Corpus](http://www.massmoca.org/event_details.php?id=42).
        Finally, view and read about Marina Abramovic's retrospective
        performance [The Artist is
        Present](http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/965)
        (the MoMA website provides access to images and a video about
        the works). Write your responses to their work, both objective
        and subjective, keeping in mind the context of the medium
        itself. How does performance and installation art expand our
        experience about what art is? Whether you like or dislike the
        works here, write about what makes these art forms unique.
