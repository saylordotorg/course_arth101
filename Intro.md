Course Syllabus for "ARTH101: Art Appreciation and Techniques"
--------------------------------------------------------------

This course is an exploration of visual art forms and their cultural
connections for the student with little experience in the visual arts.
It includes a brief study of art history, and in-depth studies of the
elements, media, and methods used in creative thought and processes. In
this course, you will learn how to develop a five-step system for
understanding visual art in all forms, based on the following:

1.  Description: A work of art from an objective point of view - its
    physical attributes, and formal construction.
2.  Analysis: A detailed look at a work of art that combines physical
    attributes with subjective statements based on the viewer's reaction
    to the work.
3.  Context: Historical, religious, or environmental information that
    surrounds a particular work of art and which helps to understand the
    work's meaning.
4.  Meaning: A statement of the work's content. A message or narrative
    expressed by the subject matter.
5.  Judgment: A critical point of view about a work of art concerning
    its aesthetic or cultural value.

After completing this course, you will be able to interpret works of art
based on this five-step system; explain the processes involved in
artistic production; identify the political, social, cultural, and
aesthetic issues that artists examine in their work; and explain the
role and effect of the visual arts in societies, history, and world
cultures.
