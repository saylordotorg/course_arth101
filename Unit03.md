         Instructions: Style really matters because each style in art is
        linked to different philosophical ideas about the world,
        humanity, the artist, and the meaning of imagery. Using the
        following links you will see a wide range of art from many
        cultures. Look for works that seem to you to exhibit the
        following ideas, and state why you think that work shows that
        idea. Include a link to the image that you are discussing. 

        -   A work of art that is a representation of a human but not a
            specific or recognizable person.
        -   A work of art that is about a specific time or place.
        -   A work of art that is an image of a god, ruler or king or
            queen.
        -   A work of art that is about the artist and their view of the
            world.
        -   A work of art that is not a picture of things in the world.

        Here are two good links to get you started:

         Instructions: Complete this assignment in which you will
        attempt to apply each of the critical perspectives that you have
        learned in this unit. Are some of the critical perspectives more
        applicable than are others to the work you have chosen? Why do
        you think this might be?  
           
         Pick one of the perspectives listed below. Using the [External
        Links](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ARTH101B-5-Learning-Activites-Module-5.pdf)
        at the bottom of the linked PDF as resources, select an artwork
        and interpret its meaning in the context of one of the six
        critical perspectives we studied in this unit. Try to uncover
        the meaning in the image you choose, then explain how your
        particular critical perspective supports your interpretation. 

        1.  Structural
        2.  Feminist
        3.  Ideological
        4.  Deconstructive
        5.  Formalist
        6.  Psychoanalytic

        This assignment will take some focus and structure. Review the
        major ideas behind your critical perspective first; then you can
        begin the search for an image that you think fits the critical
        test. From there you can begin your explanations.
