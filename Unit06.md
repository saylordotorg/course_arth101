-   **Unit 6: Architecture**  

    *This unit explores architecture, its history, and its relation to
    visual art. Architecture is the art and science of designing
    structures and spaces for human use. Architectural design is an
    artform realized through considerations of spatial design and
    aesthetics. Related to sculpture, architecture creates
    three-dimensional objects that occupy a given space and create a
    visual relationship with the area surrounding them.*

         Instructions: The biggest human impact on the environment is in
        the development of our urban landscapes. Buildings and
        transportation routes are the most prominent (Marshall McLuhan
        declared "the road is our major architectural form"). Buildings
        serve different roles in our lives; shelter, education, work,
        entertainment and travel all use different building designs.  
           
         What is a 'good' urban design? What is a 'bad' one? Do you
        prefer hard-edged designs or others that use more organic
        components? What about the use of 'green' technologies? How do
        they enter into your ideas of good urban design? As a resource,
        you can view
        [Ecliptic](http://www.pbs.org/art21/watch-now/segment-maya-lin-in-identity),
        architect Maya Lin's discussion of transforming a park in
        Michigan.

        from the linked PDF and any other sources you find appropriate,
        research and explain three examples of sustainable technologies

         What are your reactions to these examples? What is the context
        surrounding them? For example, how will they be used? What are
        the costs involved? Will they replace or interact with existing
        designs? Do you think they are good alternatives to traditional
        design?
